Circular nucleic acid sequences
(DNA and RNA)
are easier to align
if they are already in a standard orientation.
For circular Rep-encoding (eukaryote-infecting) ssDNA viruses,
the convention
is to orient sequences
to the endonuclease nick site
associated with rolling-circle replication.
See [Figure 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065352718300575#f0015)
from Zhao et al. 2019.

Branches of this repository
include sets of sequences from GenBank
converted to this standard orientation.
